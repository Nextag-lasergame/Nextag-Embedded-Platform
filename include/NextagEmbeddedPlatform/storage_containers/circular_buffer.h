 * \brief FIFO fixed size circular buffer
 *
 * The CircularBuffer is a fixed-size data structure where the front and end of the buffer are connected, eliminating the need for data to be moved around
 * when written or read from. The buffer interface follows the FIFO (first in, first out) principle, meaning that the data can only be added to the back, and read from the front.
 * Since the CircularBuffer is allocated on the stack and utilizes an array it can't be resized during runtime. The CircularBuffer is also only able to store a single datatype. Both
 * can be configured using the template arguments.
 *
 * @tparam DataType The datatype stored within the buffer
 * @tparam Size The size of the buffer
